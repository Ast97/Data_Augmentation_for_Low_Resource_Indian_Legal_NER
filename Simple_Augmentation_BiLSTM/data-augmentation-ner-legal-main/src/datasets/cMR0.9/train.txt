the O

28.5.1998 B-DATE
. O

In O
the O
present O
case O
looking O
to O
the O
evidence O
of O
complainant O
Bhojraj B-WITNESS
(PW3) O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
FIR O
could O
not O
be O
written O
up O
to O
11.00 O
p.m O
in O
the O
night O
whereas O
dead O

The O

about O
the O

mother O
Smt. O
Kavita B-OTHER_PERSON

who O
asked O
her O

the O
said O

was O
and O
then, O
it O
transpired O
that O
accused O
had O
followed O
her O

Therefore, O
in O
the O

the O

the O
respondent O

In O

the O
finding O

that O
Messrs. O

the O

It O
is O

that O

others O
were O
at O

suspected, O

as O
one O
of O
the O

that O

by O

, O
the O

of O

were O
as O
follows: O
Raj B-WITNESS
Kumar I-WITNESS
had O
installed O
a O

in O

Also, O
the O
Learned O
counsel O
for O
the O

take O
a O
plea O
that O
the O
Learned O
Judicial O
Magistrate, O
Valliyoor B-GPE
has O
treated O
the O
First O
Respondent/Wife O
as O
a O
Complainant O

has O
applied O
the O
ingredients O
of O
Section B-PROVISION
200 I-PROVISION
Cr.P.C. B-STATUTE
, O
when O
he O
examined O
her. O

Hindu O
Law O
also O
applies O
to O
non-Hindus O
like O

Memons O
of O
Bombay B-GPE

to O
Sunni O
Borahs O

in O

As O
noted O
by O
me O
earlier, O
the O
first O
proviso O
to O
section B-PROVISION

can O
be O
resorted O
to O
only O
if O
the O
assessee O
has O
not O
discharged O
the O
duty. O

It O
therefore O
emerges O
that O
non-compliance O
of O
these O
provisions O
i.e. O
Sections B-PROVISION
100 I-PROVISION
and I-PROVISION
165 I-PROVISION
CrPC B-STATUTE
would O
amount O
to O
an O
irregularity O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
same O
on O
the O
main O
case O
depends O
upon O
the O
facts O
and O
circumstances O
of O
each O
case. O

Nevertheless O
if O

the O
proposition, O
it O
is O
