the O

28.5.1998 B-DATE
. O

In O
the O
present O
case O
looking O
to O
the O
evidence O
of O
complainant O
Bhojraj B-WITNESS
(PW3) O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
FIR O
could O
not O
be O
written O
up O
to O
11.00 O
p.m O
in O
the O
night O
whereas O
dead O

The O

about O
the O

mother O
Smt. O
Kavita B-OTHER_PERSON

who O
asked O
her O

the O
said O

was O
and O
then, O
it O
transpired O
that O
accused O
had O
followed O
her O

Therefore, O
in O
the O

the O

the O
respondent O

In O

the O
finding O

that O
Messrs. O

the O

It O
is O

that O

others O
were O
at O

suspected, O

as O
one O
of O
the O

that O
