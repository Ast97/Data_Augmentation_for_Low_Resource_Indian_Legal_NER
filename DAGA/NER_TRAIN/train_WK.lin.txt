This in my view is nothing but an arbitrary decision in terms of the B-COURT Apex I-COURT Court judgment.
After <unk> B-PROVISION Section I-PROVISION <unk> of the Code, the B-COURT Supreme I-COURT Court observed that <unk> could not be any dispute that if forgery was committed while the document was in the custody of a Court, then the prosecution could be launched only with a complaint made by that Court.

The appellant in B-CASE_NUMBER MFA I-CASE_NUMBER <unk> has not disputed the occurrence of the accident on the date, time, place and in the manner as alleged by the claimants in their claim petition.

However the assessee company has been <unk> the possession of this plot as per the report of M/s B-ORG <unk> I-ORG & I-ORG Co , referred to earlier.

Hence, seizure is to be B-CASE_NUMBER <unk> & <unk> N effected and what is to be done after seizure is explained in the statutory rules.
In this case it was held by the B-COURT Supreme I-COURT Court that "the ordinary rule is that specific performance should be granted.

Therefore, the decision cited does not help the case of the appellant as the suit property is purchased by the respondent from the B-ORG DDA and the perpetual lease deed stands exclusively in the name of respondent.

The defence raised was that the suit was not maintainable in a civil Court as the subject matter of the suit was a matter of domestic concern relating to the business of the society and, therefore, barred under B-PROVISION Section I-PROVISION N , B-STATUTE Co-operative I-STATUTE Societies I-STATUTE Act and the <unk> of the <unk>
