The amount of <unk> which was received by B-OTHER_PERSON <unk> from the Insurance Corporation after the death of her husband was given to defendant No.1, which was <unk> for business purposes.
The B-COURT Supreme I-COURT Court later in B-PRECEDENT Indira I-PRECEDENT Gandhi I-PRECEDENT Vs I-PRECEDENT Raj I-PRECEDENT Narain , has struck down B-PROVISION <unk> I-PROVISION of I-PROVISION Article I-PROVISION N on the ground that it <unk> the Rule of Law and free <unk> which according to the Court <unk> the basic <unk> of the B-STATUTE Constitution .
That decision was assailed by the State Government by way of B-CASE_NUMBER LPA I-CASE_NUMBER No. I-CASE_NUMBER <unk> before the Division Bench of the High Court, which came to be allowed vide impugned judgment and order dated B-DATE <unk> .
The answer to the said question lies in the B-COURT Constitution I-COURT Bench Judgment of the B-COURT Apex I-COURT Court in the case of B-PRECEDENT <unk> I-PRECEDENT and I-PRECEDENT Ors I-PRECEDENT vs. I-PRECEDENT State I-PRECEDENT represented I-PRECEDENT by I-PRECEDENT Inspector I-PRECEDENT Of I-PRECEDENT Police N wherein it is held that it is <unk> legal for a person to be sentenced to more than one life <unk>
After hearing the parties, all the writ petitions were dismissed, by a common order, dated B-DATE <unk> .
He admits that <unk> and witness B-WITNESS Sharad I-WITNESS <unk> I-WITNESS Pawar are <unk> <unk>
So his evidence is inconsistent with prosecution case because it has come out in evidence that B-OTHER_PERSON Gopalakrishnan was taken first to the District <unk>
y and accordingly taken only the <unk> under the head house property whereas hire charges from <unk> and <unk> and other articles were treated as income from other <unk>

In the case of B-PRECEDENT Mohd. I-PRECEDENT <unk> I-PRECEDENT v.

( B-CASE_NUMBER Writ I-CASE_NUMBER Tax I-CASE_NUMBER Petition I-CASE_NUMBER <unk> ), dated B-DATE <unk> , reported in B-RESPONDENT <unk> I-RESPONDENT <unk> I-RESPONDENT N , the learned Single Judge had quashed the notices issued under B-PROVISION Section I-PROVISION N of the Act.
Further, the <unk> was <unk> by the Minister concerned, on B-DATE <unk> , and the <unk> is being used by the <unk> and, therefore, a request was made for grant of permission for <unk> of the 5th respondent <unk> shop to the <unk> building bearing <unk> & <unk> as the said building was not affected in the acquisition proceedings.

It was not just the <unk> of any member in B-ORG Parliament .
Therefore, under the facts and circumstance of the case and the reasons stated above, I do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court and up held by the Hon'ble B-COURT Apex I-COURT Court .
As per the original return of income filed on B-DATE <unk> , only <unk> C of Schedule <unk> has been filled up.
The constitutional court also step in to ensure that the policy <unk> have <unk> the effective use of its <unk> powers which the B-STATUTE Constitution has conferred on them.
In B-OTHER_PERSON <unk> I-OTHER_PERSON Maruti I-OTHER_PERSON Shinde (supra), Hon'ble B-COURT Apex I-COURT Court has observed as under:- <unk> the <unk> of a criminal case in <unk> the concerned <unk> <unk> <unk> responsible for such acquittal must necessarily be <unk>
On the other hand, the representation that gives rise to the legitimate <unk> may <unk> the <unk> procedural rights, as <unk> by the B-ORG <unk> I-ORG <unk> case.


Further, there is an apparent <unk> in the three-Judge Bench decision in B-PRECEDENT <unk> I-PRECEDENT <unk> I-PRECEDENT of I-PRECEDENT A.P. I-PRECEDENT v.

But this decision does not come in the way of the Court issuing the mandamus to consider whether the time for bringing B-PROVISION Section I-PROVISION N of the B-STATUTE Advocates I-STATUTE Act, I-STATUTE N into force had arrived or not.

A similar view had earlier been taken in the case of B-PRECEDENT State I-PRECEDENT of I-PRECEDENT Karnataka I-PRECEDENT Vs.

True it is, some investigation has been carried out by the Crime Branch of B-ORG Delhi I-ORG Police after the case being transferred from B-GPE Noida as there was total <unk> by the B-ORG Noida I-ORG police .

The objection was upheld by the Small Cause Court, the Judge being of opinion that though under B-PROVISION <unk> I-PROVISION r.

The only issue which then falls for determination is whether the flat buyers in these circumstances are <unk> by the <unk> contained in B-PROVISION clause I-PROVISION N of B-STATUTE <unk> providing compensation for delay at the rate of Rs N per <unk> feet per month.
B-WITNESS <unk> I-WITNESS Sharma <unk> states in his evidence that N years <unk> at the time of occurrence, there was <unk> in the village that B-ORG <unk> I-ORG Party members had <unk>
We are not so much concerned with the other <unk> namely, B-PROVISION <unk> I-PROVISION IV I-PROVISION to I-PROVISION IX of the N Act, except B-PROVISION Section I-PROVISION N I-PROVISION (in I-PROVISION Chapter I-PROVISION <unk> which deals with foreign contribution through scheduled (e) if the holder of the certificate has not been engaged in any reasonable activity in its chosen field for the benefit of the society for two <unk> years or has become <unk>

The B-STATUTE <unk> I-STATUTE Amendment came to the B-STATUTE Constitution by way of amendment under B-PROVISION Article I-PROVISION N and, therefore, it cannot be said to be a basic <unk> of the B-STATUTE Constitution .
